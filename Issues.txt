The issues currently with this version of iText are:

1. Menus for Find and Replace should not appear together, i.e., if Find menu is displayed, it should get hidden if
Replace is clicked.

2. Similarly for Find/Replace and Goto.

3. Context menu (Open With.. option for text files) needs to be created.
